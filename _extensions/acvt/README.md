## Features

*   **High-Quality Typesetting:** Built on Typst for clean, professional, and perfectly formatted PDF output.
*   **Data-Driven Content:** Populate your CV directly from a Google Sheet.
*   **Highly Customizable:** Easily change colors, fonts, and more through simple YAML options.
*   **All-in-One:** Generate both your CV and a matching cover letter from a single `.qmd` file.

## Installing

If you would like to add the template to an existing project directory:

```bash
quarto install extension orehren/acvt
```

Alternatively, you can create a new Quarto project bundled with a `.qmd` template file to get started:

``` bash
quarto use template orehren/Academic-CVTemplate
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your document.
