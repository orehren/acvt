# Acknowledgements

This project was made possible by the excellent work of the open-source community. We were inspired by and, in some cases, directly borrowed code and ideas from the following projects. We are deeply grateful for their contributions.

## 1. Awesome-CV

*   **Project Link:** [https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)
*   **Developers:** The Awesome-CV team and its many contributors.

The visual design and overall structure of this CV template are heavily inspired by the classic and widely-used Awesome-CV LaTeX template. Its clean, modern aesthetic is the foundation upon which this project is built.

## 2. quarto-awesomecv-typst

*   **Project Link:** [https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst](https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst)
*   **Developer:** Kazuharu Yanagimoto (@kazuyanagimoto)

This project served as a crucial starting point and proof-of-concept for creating an Awesome-CV-style template in the Quarto and Typst ecosystem. Several of the initial Typst styling rules and functions were adapted from this work.

## 3. abstract-section (Pandoc Filter)

*   **Project Link:** [https://github.com/pandoc-ext/abstract-section](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/abstract-section)
*   **Developers:** Albert Krewinkel (@tarleb), John MacFarlane (@jgm), Mickaël Canouil (@mcanouil)

The `extract-cover-letter.lua` filter in this project is a modified version of the `abstract-section.lua` filter. Their elegant and robust code for extracting a specific section from a document was adapted to handle the cover letter content.
