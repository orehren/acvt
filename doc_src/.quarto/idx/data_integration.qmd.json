This allows you to maintain your CV content in a structured way, separate from the document itself.\n\nThis guide provides a brief overview. For a full list of options, please refer to the documentation for the `academicCVtools` R package.\n\n## 1. The `academicCVtools` R Package\n\nAll data integration is handled by the `academicCVtools` R package. Ensure you have it installed as described in the **[Installation Guide](./installation.md)**.\n\nThe two key functions you will use are `load_cv_sheets()` and `format_typst_section()`.\n\n## 2. Setting Up Your Google Sheet\n\nThe functions expect your Google Sheet to be organized with one sheet (tab) per CV section. For example:\n\n*   A sheet named \"Education\"\n*   A sheet named \"Working Experiences\"\n*   A sheet named \"Skills\"\n\nEach row in a sheet represents an entry in that section. The column headers in your sheet will become the field names for each entry (e.g., \"Degree\", \"Institution\", \"Year\").\n\n## 3. Loading the Data\n\nThe first step in your `.qmd` file is to load the data from your Google Sheet. This is done in the R setup chunk.\n\n```r\n# In the [lst-setup] R chunk\ncv_sheets <- load_cv_sheets(\n  # The exact name of your Google Sheet\n  doc_identifier = \"My Academic CV Data\", \n  \n  # A list of the sheets you want to load\n  sheets_to_load = list(\n    \"Working Experiences\",\n    \"Education\",\n    \"Skills\"\n  )\n)\n```\nThe `load_cv_sheets` function will authenticate with Google, download the data, and store it in the `cv_sheets` R object.\n\n## 4. Rendering a Section in Your CV\n\nOnce the data is loaded, you can render any section in your CV with a small R code chunk.\n\nTo render the \"Education\" section, you would add the following to your `.qmd` file:\n\n```markdown\n## Education\n```\n` ` ` `r\n#| output: asis\ncv_sheets$Education |>\n  format_typst_section(\n    typst_func = \"#resume-entry\"\n  ) |> cat()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  `cv_sheets$Education`: This selects the \"Education\" data that we loaded.\n2.  `format_typst_section()`: This function takes the data and transforms it into the raw Typst code needed to render the section.\n3.  `typst_func = \"#resume-entry\"`: This tells the function to format each row of data using the `#resume-entry` function defined in the Typst template, which is the standard layout for a CV item.\n4.  `|> cat()`: This takes the generated Typst code and outputs it directly into the document.\n\nYou can create your entire CV by repeating this pattern for each section.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# How-To: Data Integration with Google Sheets\n\nA key feature of this template is its ability to populate your CV by pulling data directly from a Google Sheet.
