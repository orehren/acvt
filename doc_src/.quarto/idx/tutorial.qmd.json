The `template.qmd` File\n\nThe easiest way to get started is by using the `template.qmd` file that comes with this extension. It contains a pre-configured YAML header and the necessary R code chunks to get you started.\n\nMake a copy of this file and rename it to something like `my-cv.qmd`.\n\n## 2. Configure the YAML Header\n\nOpen your new `.qmd` file. The top section, enclosed in `---`, is the YAML header. This is where you will configure all your personal information.\n\n### 2.1. Basic Information\n\nStart by filling in your name and the document title.\n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"Documents of Application\"\nauthor:\n  firstname: \"Your Firstname\"\n  lastname: \"Your Lastname\"\n```\n\n### 2.2. Contact and Social Media\n\nFill in your contact details. You can add or remove items from this list as you see fit. The `icon` field uses Font Awesome icons.\n\n```yaml\nauthor:\n  # ...\n  contact:\n    - icon: fa address-card\n      text: \"Your Address\"\n    - icon: fa mobile-screen\n      text: \"Your Phone Number\"\n    - icon: fa envelope\n      text: \"your.email@example.com\"\n      url: \"mailto:your.email@example.com\"\n  socialmedia:\n    - icon: fa github\n      text: \"Your GitHub\"\n      url: \"https://github.com/your-username\"\n```\n\n### 2.3. The `profile-photo`\n\nBy default, the template includes a placeholder image. To use your own photo, replace the placeholder file at `assets/images/picture.jpg` with your own image.\n\nIf you prefer not to have a profile photo, you can disable it in the YAML header:\n\n```yaml\nprofile-photo: \"\"\n```\n\n## 3. The Cover Letter\n\nThe body of your cover letter is written directly in the `.qmd` file under a `## Coverletter` heading. You can use standard Markdown for formatting.\n\n```markdown\n## Coverletter\n\nDear Dr. Recipient,\n\nThis is the body of my cover letter. I can use **bold**, *italics*, and other Markdown features.\n\nSincerely,\nYour Name\n```\n\n## 4. Adding CV Content with R\n\nThe template is designed to pull data from a Google Sheet.\n\n### 4.1. Set Up Your Google Sheet\n\nThe R code in the `template.qmd` expects a Google Sheet with specific tabs (e.g., \"Working Experiences\", \"Education\"). Make a copy of the example sheet and fill it with your own data.\n\n### 4.2. Link Your Sheet\n\nIn the first R code chunk, update the `doc_identifier` to the name of your Google Sheet.\n\n```r\n# In the [lst-setup] R chunk\ncv_sheets <- load_cv_sheets(\n  doc_identifier = \"Your_Google_Sheet_Name\",\n  # ...\n)\n```\n\n### 4.3. Render a Section\n\nFor each section of your CV, there is a small R chunk that takes the data and formats it. For example, to render your work experience:\n\n```r\n## Working Experiences\n\n```{r}\n#| output: asis\ncv_sheets$`Working Experiences` |>\n  format_typst_section(\n    typst_func = \"#resume-entry\"\n  ) |> cat()\n```\nYou can add, remove, or reorder these sections to build your CV.\n\n## 5. Render the Document\n\nOnce you have configured your YAML and set up your data, you can render the final PDF. Open your terminal in the project directory and run:\n\n```bash\nquarto render my-cv.qmd\n```\n\nThis will generate a `my-cv.pdf` file containing your professional, typeset CV and cover letter.
