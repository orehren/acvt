# YAML Reference

The core configuration of your CV happens in the YAML frontmatter of your `.qmd` file. Below is a comprehensive reference of the available options.

## Basic Information

Define your personal details and contact information here.

```yaml
author:
  firstname: "Arthur"
  lastname: "Author"
  contact:
    - icon: fa address-card
      text: "123 Academic Way, Oxford"
    - icon: fa envelope
      text: "arthur@example.edu"
      url: "mailto:arthur@example.edu"
  socialmedia:
    - icon: fa github
      text: "github.com/arthur"
      url: "https://github.com/arthur"
    - icon: fa orcid
      text: "0000-0000-0000-0000"
```

## Styling

Override the default visual style (Nord theme) with your own colors and fonts.

```yaml
style:
  color-accent: "5e81ac"  # Hex code for the primary accent color
  font-header: "Lato"     # Font for headings
  font-text: "Roboto"     # Font for body text
```

## Output Options

Control which parts of the document are generated.

```yaml
render-output: "combined" # Options: "cv-only", "letter-only", "combined"
```

## Cover Letter

If you are generating a cover letter, provide the recipient and content details.

```yaml
recipient:
  name: "Dr. Hiring Manager"
  salutation: "Dr. Manager"
  address: "University of Science"
  city: "Science City"
  zip: "12345"

date: "1. March 2025"
subject: "Application for Assistant Professor Position"
```

*Note: The body of the cover letter is written in the Markdown document under the `## Coverletter` heading.*

## Google Sheets Integration

Configure the connection to your data source.

```yaml
google-document:
  auth-email: "your.email@gmail.com"
  document-identifier: "YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID"
  sheets-to-load:
    - name: "Working Experiences"
      shortname: "working"
    - name: "Research Interests"
      shortname: "interests"
```

See [Data Integration](./data_integration.qmd) for more details.
