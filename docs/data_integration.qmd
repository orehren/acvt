# Google Sheets Integration

The power of **acvt** lies in its ability to pull content dynamically from Google Sheets. This separates your content from the presentation, allowing you to update your CV simply by adding a row to a spreadsheet.

## Setup

1.  **Create a Google Sheet:** Organize your data into tabs (e.g., "Education", "Work", "Publications").
2.  **Get the ID:** Copy the unique ID string from the Sheet's URL.
3.  **Configure YAML:** Add the ID to your `.qmd` file under `google-document`.

```yaml
google-document:
  auth-email: "you@gmail.com"
  document-identifier: "1BxiMVs0XRA5n2..." # Your Sheet ID
  sheets-to-load:
    - name: "Education"       # Name of the tab in Google Sheets
      shortname: "education"  # Variable name to use in the shortcode
```

## Sheet Structure

The extension expects a tidy format. Each row represents an entry (e.g., a job), and columns represent fields (e.g., "Start", "End", "Title", "Institution").

| Start | End | Title | Institution | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2020 | Present | PhD Candidate | University of X | Researching Y... |
| 2018 | 2020 | MSc Student | University of Z | ... |

## Displaying Data

Use the `{{< cv-section >}}` shortcode to render a sheet in your document.

```markdown
## Education

{{< cv-section sheet="education" func="resume-entry" >}}
```

### Advanced Usage

You can control which columns are displayed and how they are combined.

```markdown
{{< cv-section
    sheet="working"
    func="resume-entry"
    combine_cols="detail_1, detail_2"
    combine_as="details"
    combine_sep=" • "
>}}
```

*   **sheet:** The `shortname` defined in your YAML.
*   **func:** The Typst function to render (usually `resume-entry`).
*   **combine_cols:** Merge multiple columns into one (e.g., for bullet points).
*   **exclude_cols:** Hide specific columns from the output.
