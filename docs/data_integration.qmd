# Data Integration

This template separates your content from the layout by fetching data from Google Sheets. This allows you to update your CV simply by editing a spreadsheet.

## 1. Setup

In your `.qmd` file, you configure the connection in the `google-document` YAML block:

```yaml
google-document:
  auth-email: "your.email@gmail.com"
  document-identifier: "Name_of_Your_Sheet"
  sheets-to-load:
    - name: "Working Experiences" # Tab Name
      shortname: "working"        # ID for Shortcodes
```

On the first render, R will open a browser window to ask for permission to access your Google Drive. This token is cached locally, so you only need to do this once.

## 2. Spreadsheet Structure

Your Google Sheet should have separate tabs for each section of your CV (e.g., "Experience", "Education", "Skills"). The first row of each tab must contain the **Column Headers**.

### Example: Working Experience

For a standard timeline entry, your sheet might look like this:

| start | end | title | location | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01/2020 | Present | Senior Researcher | University of X | Leading project Y... |
| 05/2018 | 12/2019 | Postdoc | Institute Z | Developed algorithm... |

**Key Concept:** The column names (`start`, `end`, `title`, etc.) are passed directly to the Typst template. The default CV entry function (`#resume-entry`) expects specific keys, but you can map your columns to these keys using the `cv-section` shortcode.

### Example: Skills

For a list of skills, you might structure it like this:

| category | skill | level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Languages | English | Native |
| Languages | German | C1 |
| Tech | R | Expert |

## 3. Connecting Data to Layout

Once your data is in the sheet, you use the `{{< cv-section >}}` shortcode to display it.

```markdown
{{< cv-section sheet="working" func="resume-entry" >}}
```

### The `resume-entry` Function
The default layout function `#resume-entry` expects the following arguments (columns):
*   `title`
*   `location`
*   `date` (or `start` + `end`)
*   `description`

If your sheet has different column names, or if you want to combine multiple columns (e.g., multiple bullet points) into the `description`, you can configure the shortcode:

```markdown
{{< cv-section
    sheet="working"
    func="resume-entry"
    combine_cols="details_*"
    combine_as="description"
    combine_prefix="• "
>}}
```

This flexibility allows you to structure your Google Sheet however you like, as long as you tell the shortcode how to map it to the template.
