# academicCVTemplate (acvt)

Welcome to the documentation for **acvt**, a powerful Quarto extension designed to create professional, data-driven academic CVs and cover letters using the Typst typesetting system.

This extension bridges the gap between structured data (Google Sheets) and high-quality typographic output (Typst), allowing you to maintain your CV data in a clean, tabular format while generating beautiful PDFs automatically.

## Key Features

*   **Data-Driven:** Fetch CV entries (experience, education, publications) directly from Google Sheets.
*   **Modular:** Combine CVs and Cover Letters in a single document or generate them separately.
*   **Typographically Superior:** Leverages [Typst](https://typst.app/) for fast, modern, and aesthetic PDF rendering.
*   **Automated:** Uses R and Lua filters to seamlessly transform data into formatted content.
*   **Customizable:** Configure fonts, colors, and layout options directly from your Quarto YAML.

## Workflow Overview

1.  **Maintain Data:** You update your CV data (e.g., new publications, jobs) in a Google Sheet.
2.  **Configure Document:** You set up a simple `.qmd` file with your bio, contact info, and styling preferences.
3.  **Render:** Quarto fetches the latest data, injects it into the template, and produces a polished PDF.

## Next Steps

*   **[Configuration](./configuration.qmd):** Learn about the YAML options available.
