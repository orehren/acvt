# Installation Guide

To use the `academicCVTemplate`, you need Quarto, R, and a specific set of R packages.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
1.  **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)** (Version 1.4+).
2.  **[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)** (Version 4.0+).

## 2. Create a Project

To start a new project with this extension, run:

```bash
quarto use template orehren/academicCVTemplate
```

Follow the prompts to create your directory.

## 3. Install R Packages

This extension relies on R to fetch and process data. You need to install the following packages in your R environment:

*   `googledrive`
*   `googlesheets4`
*   `yaml`
*   `rmarkdown`
*   `cli`
*   `purrr`
*   `checkmate`
*   `rlang`
*   `janitor`

You can install them by running this command in your R console:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "googledrive", "googlesheets4", "yaml", "rmarkdown",
  "cli", "purrr", "checkmate", "rlang", "janitor"
))
```

Once installed, you are ready to configure your data connection.
