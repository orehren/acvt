# Getting Started

To use the **acvt** extension, you need a working environment with Quarto and R.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Quarto:** Ensure you have the latest version of Quarto installed (v1.4 or higher recommended).
2.  **R:** The extension uses R to fetch data from Google Sheets. You need R installed on your system.
3.  **Typst:** Quarto handles Typst automatically, so no separate installation is usually required, but having the CLI can be useful for debugging.

## Installing the Extension

You can install the extension directly into your Quarto project directory.

```bash
quarto add orehren/acvt
```

This command will download the extension files into the `_extensions` folder of your project.

## Project Setup

The extension is designed to work within a Quarto project. We recommend initializing a new project using the provided template structure.

```bash
quarto use template orehren/acvt
```

This will create a starter `.qmd` file and the necessary configuration files to get you running immediately.

## R Dependencies

The extension relies on several R packages (e.g., `googlesheets4`, `renv`) to handle data fetching. When you first render the project, Quarto should detect the R dependency.

To ensure a smooth experience, we recommend using `renv` to manage the environment:

1.  Initialize `renv` in your project root:
    ```r
    renv::init()
    ```
2.  Install the required packages (these are listed in the extension's scripts):
    ```r
    install.packages(c("googlesheets4", "googledrive", "yaml", "dplyr", "tidyr", "purrr", "cli", "checkmate", "janitor"))
    ```
