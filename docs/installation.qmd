# Installation Guide

To use the `academicCVTemplate`, you need to have Quarto and R installed on your system. The template handles its own dependencies using the `renv` package.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)** (Version 1.4 or later).
2.  **[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)** (Version 4.0 or later).
3.  **[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)** (Recommended for the best experience).

## 2. Get Started with the Template

There are two ways to use the template: creating a new project or adding it to an existing one.

### Option A: Create a New Project (Recommended)

To start a fresh project with this template, run the following command in your terminal (or RStudio Terminal tab):

```bash
quarto use template orehren/academicCVTemplate
```

You will be prompted to:
1.  **Trust the authors?** (Type `Y` if you trust the extension).
2.  **Directory name:** Enter the name for your new project folder (e.g., `my-cv`).

Quarto will create the directory and download all necessary files, including the `renv.lock` file for dependency management.

### Option B: Add to an Existing Project

If you already have a Quarto project, navigate to its root directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
quarto add orehren/academicCVTemplate
```

## 3. Set Up the R Environment

This template uses R to fetch data from Google Sheets and process it. To ensure reliability, the project uses `renv` to manage R package versions.

1.  Open the project in RStudio (open the `.Rproj` file) or navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Open the **R Console**.
3.  Run the following command to restore the project environment:

```r
if (!require("renv")) install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

This will download and install all the exact package versions needed for the template to work correctly.

## 4. Verify Installation

To verify that everything is set up correctly, try rendering the example template. In the terminal, run:

```bash
quarto render academicCV-template.qmd
```

**Note:** The first render might fail or ask for authentication if you haven't configured the Google Sheets connection yet. This is normal! Proceed to the **[Data Integration](./data_integration.qmd)** section to set up your data source, or check the **[Tutorial](./tutorial.qmd)** to see how to start customizing.
