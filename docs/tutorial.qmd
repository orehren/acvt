# Tutorial: Creating Your First CV

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a complete CV and cover letter using the `academicCV-template.qmd` file.

## 1. The Template File

The template comes with a file named `academicCV-template.qmd`. This file serves as the control center for your CV. It contains:
1.  **YAML Header:** Metadata, configuration, and personal details.
2.  **Shortcodes:** Placeholders that tell Quarto where to insert your CV sections and publications.

Make a copy of this file and rename it to something like `my-cv.qmd`.

## 2. Configure Personal Details (YAML)

Open `my-cv.qmd`. The top section enclosed in `---` is the YAML header.

### 2.1. Basic Information

Update your name, position, and the document title.

```yaml
title: "Application for Assistant Professor"
author:
  firstname: "Jane"
  lastname: "Doe"
position: "PhD Candidate in Computational Biology"
```

### 2.2. Contact & Social Media

Add your contact details. You can use any [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon by specifying its class (e.g., `fa envelope`, `fa brands github`).

```yaml
author:
  # ...
  contact:
    - icon: fa envelope
      text: "jane.doe@example.com"
      url: "mailto:jane.doe@example.com"
    - icon: fa location-dot
      text: "New York, USA"
  socialmedia:
    - icon: fa brands github
      text: "github.com/janedoe"
      url: "https://github.com/janedoe"
```

### 2.3. Profile Photo

To change the profile photo, replace the file at `_extensions/acvt/assets/images/picture.jpg` or update the path in the YAML:

```yaml
profile-photo: "path/to/your/photo.jpg"
# To disable the photo:
# profile-photo: ""
```

## 3. The Cover Letter

If you want to include a cover letter, configure the recipient details and write the content in the body of the document.

### 3.1. Recipient Details

```yaml
recipient:
  name: "Dr. Alan Turing"
  salutation: "Dear Dr. Turing,"
  address: "Department of Computer Science"
  city: "Bletchley Park"
  zip: "MK3 6EB"
date: "October 24, 2025"
subject: "Application for Research Position"
```

### 3.2. Letter Content

Write your cover letter text under the `## Coverletter` heading in the main body of the document using standard Markdown.

```markdown
## Coverletter

I am writing to express my interest in...
```

## 4. Connecting Your Data

The power of this template comes from its integration with Google Sheets. Instead of typing your work history manually into the document, you manage it in a spreadsheet.

1.  **Create your Sheet:** See the **[Data Integration](./data_integration.qmd)** guide for the expected format.
2.  **Configure YAML:**

```yaml
google-document:
  auth-email: "your.email@gmail.com"
  document-identifier: "Name_of_Your_Google_Sheet"
  sheets-to-load:
    - name: "Working Experiences" # Tab name in Google Sheets
      shortname: "working"        # ID to use in shortcodes
    - name: "Education"
      shortname: "education"
```

## 5. Adding CV Sections (Shortcodes)

To display a section from your data (e.g., your work experience), use the `{{< cv-section >}}` shortcode. You place this directly in the document body.

```markdown
## Working Experience

{{< cv-section sheet="working" func="resume-entry" >}}
```

*   `sheet`: Matches the `shortname` you defined in the YAML.
*   `func`: The layout function to use (e.g., `resume-entry` for standard CV entries, `research-interests` for simple lists).

See the **[Shortcodes Reference](./shortcodes.qmd)** for advanced options like filtering columns or combining bullet points.

## 6. Adding Publications

To add your publication list, configure the bibliography file in the YAML and use the `{{< publication-list >}}` shortcode.

```yaml
publication-list:
  bib_file: "my_pubs.bib"
  bib_style: "apa.csl"
```

```markdown
## Publications

{{< publication-list >}}
```

## 7. Render

To generate your PDF, run:

```bash
quarto render my-cv.qmd
```
