\title{Load Multiple Sheets from a Google Sheet}
\usage{
load_cv_sheets(doc_identifier, sheets_to_load, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{doc_identifier}{A character string representing the ID, URL, or a unique
name of the target Google Sheets document.}

\item{sheets_to_load}{A list or character vector specifying which sheets to
load.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Named List/Vector}: The names of the list should be the exact
sheet names (tabs) to read (e.g., \code{"Working Experiences"}), and the
values should be the desired names for the list elements in the output
(e.g., \code{"work_exp"}).
\item \strong{Unnamed Character Vector}: A vector of the exact sheet names to
read. The output list names will be automatically generated by cleaning
the sheet names.
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed down to \code{read_cv_sheet} for every
sheet being loaded (e.g., \code{na_strings}, \code{col_types}).}
}
\value{
A named list where each element is a \code{tibble} of data from a sheet.
}
\description{
Reads data from multiple sheets of a Google Sheet document and returns them
as tibbles in a named list.
}
\details{
This function serves as a high-level wrapper around \code{read_cv_sheet}.
It validates its arguments and then prepares a loading configuration based
on the \code{sheets_to_load} parameter. It iteratively calls \code{read_cv_sheet} for
each specified sheet and assigns the resulting tibble to the correct name
in the output list.
